:wrench: Installation and settings

- If you haven't install the Zepeto World you can check how to do it <a href="https://docs.zepeto.me/studio/reference/installation_and_settings">Here!</a>

- Once you have installed Zepeto, you have to pull this repository and you can do it in 3 ways
  - [Cloning](Cloning-the-project)
  - <a href="#download">Downloading it</a>
  - <a href="#package">Getting the package</a>

### Cloning the project

First we go to the [Code] button and click it.

Then click on the icon to copy the link of the repository (make sure that you are on the https tab) or copy it manually.

**Transformable item Manager**

You can create a new item and drag and drop it on the list of items and it will create a new button automatically.

<br><img src = "docs/images/transformableitemsmanager.png" alt = "transformable item manager img"></img><br>

#####Item creation
To create a new item for the props we need to create a new item scriptable object (you can duplicate one of the existent)

<br><img src = "docs/images/scriptables.png" alt = "transformable item manager img"></img><br>

Every scriptable object will need some references to create a new object.

<br><img src = "docs/images/itemtransformableSO.png" alt = "transformable item manager img"></img><br>

| Variable    | Utility                                                                           |

| Icon Sprite | The sprite that will be shown in the button on the UI                             |

######ITEM PREFAB WARNING:
 It **HAS** to have a **boxcollider**, it **cannot** be other type. It also has to have a mesh filter.

**Lobby Element Pool**
This is a pool of items to create in the ui of the lobby, the first variable **Ui Prefab** saves the prefab that will be created for the pool, and the **Parent Transform** saves the transform that will be the parent for those items.
To learn about the pool pattern you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern">check it here.</a>
